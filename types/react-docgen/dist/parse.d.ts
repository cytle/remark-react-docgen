/**
 * Takes JavaScript source code and returns an object with the information
 * extract from it.
 *
 * `resolver` is a strategy to find the AST node(s) of the component
 * definition(s) inside `src`.
 * It is a function that gets passed the program AST node of
 * the source as first argument, and a reference to the parser as second argument.
 *
 * This allows you define your own strategy for finding component definitions.
 *
 * `handlers` is an array of functions which are passed a reference to the
 * component definitions (extracted by `resolver`) so that they can extract
 * information from it. They get also passed a reference to a `Documentation`
 * object to attach the information to. A reference to the parser is parsed as the
 * last argument.
 *
 * If `resolver` returns an array of component definitions, `parse` will return
 * an array of documentation objects. If `resolver` returns a single node
 * instead, `parse` will return a documentation object.
